# Introduction

In this project, I use pygame to make a visualization DFS and BFS program. If you're interested in pygame, I highly reccommend you for this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=7239s&pp=ygUGcHlnYW1l">Pygame by Clear Code</a>

To run pygame project, you should have installed it before. This video may help you: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uOTEOJ48G8&pp=ygUVaG93IHRvIGluc3RhbGwgcHlnYW1l">How to install Pygame</a>
